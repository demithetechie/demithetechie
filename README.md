### Hello, I'm Demi 👋

😄 Pronouns: she/her

I am a 3rd year Computer Science Student at the University of Nottingham. I have a lot of interests within technology, and they often change every few months. Right now, I'm obsessed with iOS Development.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- A mobile app project 
  - Working with a friend to build a cross-platform mobile application
  - Currently in the design phase :)
- A discord bot
  - Working on a discord registration bot that will verify 1st year students onto the UoN server 
 
🌱 I’m currently learning:
- iOS Development
  - Doing a Udemy course on iOS Development
  - Learning how SwiftUI works 
  
⚡ 2 fun facts: 
- I interned at Google as a STEP Intern in 2021 💻
- I'm a musician (I play piano, violin, ukulele and I sing) 🎶
  
💬 Ask me about:
- Advice on getting into tech as a computer science student
- General university advice :)
