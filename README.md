- Uni work LOL
- Going crazy on X @demithetechie
 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- MERN
  - Building a few projects with the MERN stack
- Machine learning
  - Building ML models with Python
  
âš¡ 2 fun facts: 
- I interned at Google as a STEP Intern in 2021 ðŸ’»
- I'm a musician (I play piano, violin, ukulele and I sing) ðŸŽ¶
  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
