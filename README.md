### Hello, I'm Demi 👋

😄 Pronouns: she/her

I am a Master's (4th year) Computer Science Student at the University of Nottingham. I'm passionate about the intersection of data science, music theory and computer science. 

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- 🌳 **Sounding Climate Change:** Exploring how climate change data could be used to inform musical insights and ideas for climate-related concepts. I'm building a tool to transform climate change data into musical motifs and phrases. This tool will become another interface for musical expression.
- 🏥 **Breast Cancer ML Study:** Exploring a Breast Cancer dataset to perform regression on response-free survival (RFS), and binary classification on pathological complete response (pCR). Using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and skit-learn and working in a group of 5 people.
- 👩🏾‍💻 **Ovn. Tinder for recipes:** To learn more about software quality assurance, we are building a recipe dating app that will match individuals based on what recipes they like, as well as their looks. The app frontend is a native Android application with Java, the backend is NodeJS with TypeScript.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- 📈 **Linear Programming:** Learning how to apply linear programming principles to solve LP problems in different contexts and situations. Prepping for a coursework that will involve solving a large-scale LP problem.
- 🔬 **Research in CS:** Building myself up to become a well-rounded researcher in the field of computer science.

👩🏾‍💻 Favourite coding languages:
- Python (obviously)
- Kotlin
- Swift
  
⚡ 2 fun facts: 
- I interned at Google as a STEP Intern in 2021 💻
- I'm a musician (I play piano, violin, ukulele and I sing) 🎶
